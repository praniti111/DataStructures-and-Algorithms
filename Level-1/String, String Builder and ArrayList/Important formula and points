# Formula to convert to Upper Case or to LowerCase
'A' - 'a' = -32 
'a' - 'A' =  32
A can be replaced for any Capital alphabet and 'a' can be replaced by any lowercase alphabet
eg : ('p' - 'P') = ('a' - 'A') = 32 
Can convert a word or a String to lower or uppercase (Toggle between them)

2. Java Strings are Immutable i.e. it cannot change
   Referances are mutable but instances(objects) are not.
   
3. StringBuilder : is a String which is mutable ie. Referance can be changed and Object a=can be changed.
Syntax : Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
         String str = sc.nextInt();
         StringBuilder new = StringBuilder(str);// will create a new SB
         
   Operations performed
   1. Update(.setcharAt(index, replacing element)) eg. strb.setcharAt(3,'d')
   2. delete(.deletecharAt(index)) eg. strb.deletecharAt(1)
   3. insert(.insert(index, inserting element)) eg. strb.insert(2,'e')
   4. append(Inserts at the last(end) .append(element)) eg. strb.append('s')
   SB is used when we want to update obj more often in the same obj.
   
4. IF THERE IS A "new" KEYWORD IT IS BOUND TO CREATE A NEW OBJECT IN HEAP(COMPULSORY)

5. Time Complexity will be less in SB than string as all the changes(update, insert, delete, append) are done on the same string object. it doesnot create a new object for every chnage, like the string.
 TC for SB = O(N) , TC for String O(N2)
   
6. toString() Method: This will convert all the datatypes to String and return, Any datatype in java will have a toString method.


7. ArrayList : Dynamic Array memory, unlike array as it is static.
Syntax : ArrayList<Integer> arr = new ArrayList<>(); // Integer is the wrapper class for int.
We cannot create the ArrayList with primitive datatypes, we have to use wrapper class to create an array.
CRUD Opeartions in ArrayList
//C = create db(declare and initialize) //R = get //U=set //D = delete
